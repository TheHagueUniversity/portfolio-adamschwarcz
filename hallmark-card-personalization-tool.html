              <h1>Empathizing with people</h1>
              <p>As part of “Project Bespoke”, each design team member was assigned one user as a base of our research. Our research consisted of several interviews and informal meetings with our users, which provided us with a bunch of interesting gift-giving & receiving insights. To get a deeper sense of what's important for the user during gift-giving & receiving we asked our users to describe to us or if possible to bring and show the most important gift or card they have ever received.</p>

                After gathering and analyzing all the interesting stories about the experiences from giving or receiving gifts we needed to an overview and highlight the most alarming problems that users are facing. Then we eventually came up with "How Might We" questions that would allowed us to transit straight to the ideation phase.</p>

              <h1>Coming up with ideas & concept</h1>
              <p>To come up with a lot of ideas to converge from we sketched 60 ideas in total as a design team (30 per person). To converge from that amount of ideas we discussed each one of the ideas and how they address the problems of our users as well as how they how they contribute to the overall experience in terms of UX factors. </p>

              <h1>Prototyping & testing</h1>
              <p>Before diving into high-fidelity prototyping we drafted our vision of the interface on paper. Paper prototype consisted of several screens that the user could go through to get a grasp of what will the tool be capable of and be able to provide us with some kind of feedback. Followingly we tested a few respondents and gathered insights about some usability problems that we have not tought about beforehand.</p>

              </div>

              <p>From that point we moved onto digital protyping a started building the inital components and building blocks of the UI. In our digital design process we really strived for the engaging & activating design that complies with the visual & aesthetics preferences of our users as well as to provide Hallmark with consistent design that fits to their visual language.</p>
