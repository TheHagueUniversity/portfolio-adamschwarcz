              <h1>Definition of problems</h1>
              <p>Since I have delivered quite strong UX study with a lot of suggestions of what to improve for TUI Slovakia as a real client in late 2018, I decided to redsign it's landing experience myself. I took some of the components that I recommended to redesign and improve and followed my earlier recommendation in the design later on. </p>

            <div class="brand content-block">
              <h2>Step 2&nbsp; • &nbsp;February 2019</h2>
              <h1>Analysing brand guidelines</h1>
              <p>From UX perspective we have been very limited on what could be improved as TUI has it's fixed guidelines for their digital presence and user interface for now. We really dug into guidelines of TUI's visual communication and tried to find the things we could work with and eventually improve. We discovered that TUI Slovakia had some serious problems in keeping up with the set guidlines provided and documented in TUI's brandnet. Before getting into digital design I intensively studied and educated myself on TUI's rules and guidelines that we could implement and improve into the new version landing page experience.</p>

            <div class="components content-block">
              <h2>Step 2&nbsp; • &nbsp;February 2019</h2>
              <h1>Coming up with components</h1>
              <p>And then I jumped to the fun part. I designed fully responsive and structurized components that connect into much more visually appealing interface that TUI is using in the meanwhile. All of the components has the besT UX in mind based on what I suggested in complex UX review that we provided for TUI Slovakia in late 2018.</p>

              <h2>Step 2&nbsp; • &nbsp;February 2019</h2>
              <h1>Redesigned landing experience</h1>
              <p>The goal for the final design was to enhance the engagement and usability of TUI's landing page. I finished this personal project by finalizing the core of the design and functionality of the landing page's hero section and very important search function. The results, see for yourself below.</p>
